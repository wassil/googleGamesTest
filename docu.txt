setup:
	have to create game in their online service  https://play.google.com/apps/publish/?dev_acc=14752603202825848037#GameListPlace
	update android sdk(broke eclipse), redownload android sdk, update
	downloaded libraries, included into eclipse workspace, set dependency
	code examples tells me to use BaseGameUtils, link to github repo with android examples
	download code, locate the library in repo, add to my project
	made my activity extend their BaseGameActivity
	set it up, run "java.lang.IllegalStateException: A fatal developer error has occurred. Check the logs for further information." there is nothing in logs
	googled, its in unfiltered log, I had to add app id to strings.xml
	finally got the integration
	*see user point of view*
	nope, I was able to TOS the app and it wasn't working afterwards

development:
	cannot use emulator, google play services must be installed
	after initial login, I'm no longer able to log in again
	restarting eclipse fixed that

	final GoogleApiClient client = ((BaseGameActivity)getActivity()).getApiClient();

achievements:
	defined on server - ids to use them
	set:
	Games.Achievements.unlock(client, getResources().getString(R.string.achievement_click_button_once));
	Games.Achievements.increment(client, getResources().getString(R.string.achievement_clicked_button_10_times), 1);
	show:
	startActivityForResult(
	  Games.Achievements.getAchievementsIntent(client), 
	  Const.REQUEST_ACHIEVEMENTS
	);

	using only incremental achievements did not work for me, had to add one regular one, afterwards everything worked
	there is no way to "reset" achievement in dashboard

leaderboards:
	defined on server - ids to use them
	Games.Leaderboards.submitScore(client, getResources().getString(R.string.leaderboard_score), 1337);
	startActivityForResult(
		Games.Leaderboards.getLeaderboardIntent(client, getResources().getString(R.string.leaderboard_score)),
		Const.REQUEST_LEADERBOARDS
	);

gifts:
	give a gift or request one
	accepting request automatically sends containing gift to the person
	even for people not playing your game - links to play store
	ability to mute app
	ability to turn off all the gifts
	kinda generic visuals
	demo app is just not in the repo

multiplayer:
	not shipping love - documentation AND examples out of date
	oh wow, there are rookie mistakes in examples

documentation:

user point of view:
	api uses thing called google game services, 
	to use google game services, you must use google+ account.
	To do that you have to accept that "By continuing, you agree that Google will use your location..."
	after that you have to tos the app(similar to ours)

	google has standalone games app with games feed, discovery etc.
